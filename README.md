# Octoid

Swift module with just enough GitHub API support for ActionStatus and related tooling.

I'm not even slightly pretending that this is good enough for general purpose use.

## Design

Octoid is intentionally small and built around a few simple ideas:

- **Small API models**: lightweight `Codable` value types for the GitHub payloads ActionStatus needs (`Event`, `WorkflowRun`, `Workflow`, etc).
- **Resource resolvers**: each endpoint is represented by a `ResourceResolver` that builds the request path (`EventsResource`, `WorkflowResource`, `WorkflowsResource`).
- **Polling session**: `Octoid.Session` wraps `JSONSession.Session` with GitHub defaults (base URL and bearer token usage).
- **Composable processors**: response handling is split into processors (`MessageProcessor`, `UnchangedProcessor`, custom test processors), so success/error/unchanged behavior can be composed explicitly.
- **Opt-in workflow discovery**: callers can discover workflows first (`WorkflowsResource`) and then request runs by workflow ID, avoiding fragile filename assumptions.

The package prefers focused behavior over broad API coverage, and aims to keep public surface area small and explicit.

## Testing

Testing setup, live integration-test configuration, and environment variables are documented in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).
