# Agent Guidance Notes

This folder was refreshed from shared guidance in `~/.local/share/agents` for this Swift package repository.

## Regenerated/Copied Files

- `Principles.md`
- `Testing.md`
- `Trusted Sources.md`
- `Good Code.md`
- `Swift.md`
- `GitHub.md`

## Included Modules

- Core cross-cutting modules: Principles, Testing, Trusted Sources, Good Code.
- Language module: Swift.
- Service module: GitHub.

## Excluded Modules

- `languages/Python.md`: repository is Swift-only.
- `languages/JavaScript.md`: repository is Swift-only.
- `technologies/SwiftUI.md`: package has no SwiftUI usage.

## Stack Assumptions

- Swift Package Manager project (`Package.swift`).
- Core implementation language is Swift.
- GitHub API integration is a primary domain concern.

## Local vs Shared Conflicts

- No direct conflicts identified. Local repository constraints (API compatibility, secure credential handling, integration-test token handling) are preserved in `AGENTS.md`.
